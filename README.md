# LightningLocation_MC
The Monte Carlo method is a computational technique that involves using random sampling to simulate and analyse complex systems, allowing for the estimation of probabilities, uncertainties, and behaviour patterns through repeated iterations.

For assessing Lightning Location, the method involves simulating lightning strikes across a defined area, adding features to mimic real-world conditions. Detected strike locations from the station are compared to the simulated strikes, statistically evaluating system reliability.

The real lightning current distribution and station performance (detection pattern) are input modules of the tool and are modelled as described in the following documentation, allowing changes without interfering in the core code:


The figure below illustrates the code structure of the tool, the current distribution and detection pattern generate input files needed for execution:
