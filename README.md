# LightningLocation_MC
The Monte Carlo method for Lightning Location simulates lightning strikes in a defined area, incorporating real-world conditions like strike current distribution and station detection behavior. Detected strike locations are compared to simulated ones, allowing for a statistical evaluation of the detection system's reliability and accuracy.
